The Casting.py
This Python script shows how to cast a variable—that is, convert it from one data type to another—from an integer to a string.

An explanation
My_score is a variable that the script first sets to the integer value 201. The my_score's type and value are then printed. Using the str() method, the script then turns my_score from an integer to a string to illustrate the casting procedure. After the casting procedure, it prints the type and value of my_score at the end.
