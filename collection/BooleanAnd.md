This Python script demonstrates how to evaluate two boolean variables utilizing the logical AND operator (and).

Overview
Using the logical AND operator (and), the script evaluates the combination of two boolean variables, is_alive and time_remaining. At first, time_remaining is set to False and is_alive to True. The result of the logical AND operation between these two variables is subsequently displayed by the script.

Use
Make sure Python is installed on your system. If not, you can obtain it from python.org and install it.
To yourÂ machine, download the BooleanAnd.py script file.
Launch a command prompt or terminal.
Locate the script by going to its directory.
Utilizing the following command, run the script:
python BooleanAnd.py


For every test scenario, the script will show the outcome of the logical AND operation between is_alive and time_remaining.
Case Studies
The first test case assertion is that time_remaining is False and is_alive is True in the initial state. False should be the outcome.

Test Case Assertion 2: The outcome ought to be True following the update of time_remaining to True.
