DateTest.py
This Python script demonstrates how to compute age and carry out date-related tasks utilizing datetime objects.

Description
The user gets asked to enter their date of birth (DOB) in the form of DD Mmm YYYY by the script. After that, it transforms the input into a DateTime object and uses the current date to calculate the user's age. The generated age is displayed by the script in several ways, which include the exact age, age in days, and age in years. It also does date arithmetic, estimating the day the user will be two times as old as they are today by adding 10 days to the current date.

Check that Python is installed on the machine you're using. If not, you can download it from python.org and install it.
Download the DateTest.py script file to your local desktop.
Open a command prompt or terminal.
Locate the script by going within its directory.
Utilizing the following command, run the script:
python DateTest.py

To review the calculated age and date-related methods, feedback on the date of your birth as instructed.
