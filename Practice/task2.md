# To-Do List Organiser

This program written in Python uses the concepts of object-oriented programming to create a basic to-do list organizer. There are two classes in it: `Task` and `TodoList}. A single job is represented by the `job` class, which has properties such as name, description, and completion status. A collection of tasks is represented by the `TodoList` class, which includes methods for stating, marking as complete, and retrieving pending and finished tasks.


## Guidelines

Use this script by doing the following:

1. Installation: Verify that your computer is running Python. Python 3. x is required for this script.
2. Download: Use this repository to clone or download the `task.py` file.
3. Execution: Locate the script's directory by opening a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run Script: Use the following command to run the script:
5. Adding Tasks: By generating `Task} instances and adding them to the `TodoList} using the `add_task} function, the script enables you to add tasks to the to-do list.
6. Marking Tasks Complete: The `mark_task_complete} function accepts the task name as an argument and allows you to mark a task as complete.
7. Showing Tasks: The script will use the `get_pending_tasks` and `get_completed_tasks` methods to show pending and completed tasks, respectively, after adding tasks and marking them as complete.
8. Customisation: You may include the script in your projects or make necessary modifications to it.
