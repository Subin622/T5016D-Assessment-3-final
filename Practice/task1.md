# Factorial Calculation

This Python software uses recursion to get the factorial of a given non-negative integer. It defines two functions: `main()` to receive user input and display the result, and `factorial(n)` to compute the factorial of a number {n}.


## Guidelines

Use this script by doing the following:

1. Installation: Verify that your computer is running Python. Python 3. x is required for this script.
2. Download: Use this repository to clone or download the `factorial_calculator.py` file.
3. Execution: Locate the script's directory by opening a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run Script: Use the following command to run the script:
5. Input: The script will ask you to input a number for which you wish to compute the factorial when it runs.
6. Output: Following that, the script will calculate and show the entered number's factorial.
7. Error Handling: The script will alert you if you enter a negative value because factorial is not specified for negative integers. The script will remind you to provide a valid integer if you enter a value that is not an integer.
8. Customisation: You may include the script in your projects or modify it.
9. Contributing: We would appreciate your help! Please feel free to make modifications, send a pull request, and fork this repository.
10. Contact: Open an issue in this repository with any queries or problems.
11. Licence: The MIT Licence is used to distribute this script. Details may be found in the LICENCE file.

This script may be used to calculate factorials in various applications and is a basic example of recursion in Python.
