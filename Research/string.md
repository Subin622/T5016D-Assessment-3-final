The Palindrome Checker and Symmetry
This Python software detects if a string is symmetrical or palindrome.

Checker for Palindromes as
The function palindrome(a) checks if the string given is a palindrome. A word, phrase, number, or other character sequence that reads the same both forward and backward is referred to as a palindrome. The function analyses characters as they move from both ends of the string to the middle. The string is a palindrome if every single character corresponds.

Checker for Symmetry
The function symmetry(a) detects if the input string is symmetrical. If the characters in a string are the same on each side, then the string is considered to be symmetrical. The middle character for strings of odd length isn't taken into account. The function moves towards the center of the string and compares corresponding characters at the beginning and finish. A string is said to be symmetrical if all of the matching characters match.

Application
Define the string whose symmetry and palindrome you wish to verify.
To find out if the string is a palindrome, use the palindrome(string) function.

To find out if the string is symmetrical, use the symmetry(string) function.
